# Data visualization and statistical analysis of whole-genome sequencing of ZBTB18


- Data available in this repository is based on experiments detailed in manuscript 
'Mapping the genetic landscape of ZBTB18 in the embryonic mouse cortex'

- The code available is for data visualization and statistical analysis of whole-genome sequencing dataset (RNA sequencing 
experiments) performed on embryonic brain tissues (~E15) upon deletion of the transcription factor ZBTB18.

- The primary dataset is an output of DESEQ2 the majority of the code intersects
the primary dataset with multiple databases such as MotifMap (Transcription factor motifs), HT (Human Transcription factors database), 
SFARI (Autism gene database), and RVIS (Residual Variation Intolerance Score) all available in this package. 

- Raw sequencing data is available at GEO******


-The code available in this repository is written in R programming language
