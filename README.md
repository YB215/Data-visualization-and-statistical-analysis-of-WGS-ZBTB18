# whole-genome-sequencing-ZBTB18

- Code for data visualization and statistical analysis of whole-genome sequencing dataset
as part of a manuscript 'Mapping the genetic landscape of ZBTB18 in the embryonic mouse cortex'

- Data available in this repository is based on experiments conducted on RNA sequencing 
experiments performed on embryonic brain tissues upon deletion of the transcription factor ZBTB18.

- The primary dataset is an output of DESEQ2 the majority of the code intersects
the primary dataset with multiple databases such as MotifMap (Transcription factor motifs), SFARI (Autism gene database),
and RVIS (Residual Variation Intolerance Score). 

- Raw data is available at GEO******







# The code available in this repository is written in R programming language
